              <div className="text">Balistos is a simple application that uses the power of
                  YouTube to let you share your music taste with your friends or people with
                  the same ideas. Balistos lets you add music videos you like to the common
                  playlist, where all connected users can listen to them together and vote up
                  the ones they like.</div>

              <h2>How do I use Balistos?</h2>
              <div className="text">Simple! You may search all the playlists and select the one
                  you like by simply clicking on it. To be able to use full functionality of
                  Balistos such as adding songs and voting you are required to register an account.
                  If you don&apos;t like any of the playlist you may also create your own and share
                   it with your friends. If you want to make it exclusive for your friends, make
                   sure you protect it with password.</div>
